# üêö AutoBandit

This repository contains an automated Bash script that solves the first **25 levels (0 ‚Üí 1 up to 24 ‚Üí 25)** of the Bandit challenge from OverTheWire.

The purpose of this project is to automate the learning process of basic security concepts, file manipulation, networking, and common Linux commands through SSH connections.

---

## üöÄ What does this script do?

- Connects via SSH to each level of the Bandit challenge.
- Automatically extracts the password for the next level.
- Stores the captured credentials in a `PASS` file.
- Automatically deletes temporary files after completing all levels.
- Implements retry logic in case a password was not stored correctly.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings

- Avoid modifying the script unless you understand what you're doing, especially the automated SSH connections.

- Some levels depend on timing (e.g., cron jobs). The script waits automatically where necessary.

- Make sure you have a stable internet connection to avoid SSH connection errors.
